 * -------------------------------------Questions------------------------------------------
 * What items would be necessary if you were playing a game of Elevens at your desk (not on the
 * computer)? List the private instance variables needed for the ElevensBoard class.
 * 
 * You would just need a deck of cards.
 * board_size, ranks, suits, point_values, deck, cards, i_am_debugging
 * 
 * Write an algorithm that describes the actions necessary to play the Elevens game.
 * 
 * create board
 * deal cards
 * check to see if cards selected add to 11 and if so, remove them
 * check to see if cards selected are a k, q and j and if so, remove them
 * check to see if there are any moves left
 * if there are still moves left continue checking for moves; if not, end game and restart
 * 
 * 
 * Now examine the partially implemented ElevensBoard.java file found in the Activity7
 * Starter Code directory. Does the ElevensBoard class contain all the state and behavior
 * necessary to play the game?
 * 
 * it seems to have most, if not all of the functionality
 * 
 * ElevensBoard.java contains three helper methods. These helper methods are private
 * because they are only called from the ElevensBoard class.
 * 		a. Where is the dealMyCards method called in ElevensBoard?
 * 
 * it is called in the newGame method and the elevensboard constructor
 * 
 * 		b. Which public methods should call the containsPairSum11 and containsJQK methods?
 * 
 * containsPairSum11 should be called in the isplaypossible method. containsJQK should also be called in the isplaypossible method
 * 
 * 		c. It’s important to understand how the cardIndexes method works, and how the list that it
 * returns is used. Suppose that cards contains the elements shown below. Trace the execution
 * of the cardIndexes method to determine what list will be returned. Complete the diagram
 * below by filling in the elements of the returned list, and by showing how those values index
 * cards. Note that the returned list may have less than 9 elements.
 * 
 * 
 * 		d. Complete the following printCards method to print all of the elements of cards that are
 * indexed by cIndexes.
 * public static printCards(ElevensBoard board) {
 * 		List<Integer> cIndexes = board.cardIndexes();
 * 		System.out.println(cIndexes);
 * }
 * 
 * 		e. Which one of the methods that you identified in question 4b above needs to call the
 * cardIndexes method before calling the containsPairSum11 and containsJQK
 * methods? Why?
 * 
 * the isplaypossible method
 * 
 * 
 *
